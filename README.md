# DESCRIPTION
This pipeline automates the process of pulling the latest Dockerfile from our GitHub repository, using the image from our dockerhub to running a container on an Ubuntu system. Inside the container, it installs Apache, deploys an index.html file and ensures the web server is running for accessibility.
